            I&apos;m a software engineer with over 4 years of experience in
            mobile app development and 2 years in SaaS products. I have a strong
            foundation in DevOps, ERPNext, and have freelanced as both a
            software developer and graphic designer. I&apos;m passionate about
            building functional, high-performing applications using technologies
            like Flutter and React/Next.js.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            From a young age, I&apos;ve been drawn to problem-solving and creating
            things that make people&apos;s lives easier. When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m
            either exploring new technologies or gaming to unwind.
