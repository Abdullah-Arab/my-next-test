            I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience in mobile app development and 2 years in SaaS products. I have a strong foundation in DevOps, ERPNext, and have freelanced as both a software developer and graphic designer. I'm passionate about building functional, high-performing applications using technologies like Flutter and React/Next.js.

            From a young age, I've been drawn to problem-solving and creating things that make people's lives easier. When I'm not coding, I'm either exploring new technologies or gaming to unwind.
